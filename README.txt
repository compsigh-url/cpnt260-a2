The hardest thing about this assignment was getting flexbox to work the way I wanted it to. My first instinct whenever anything goes wrong is to Google it, and through a series of searches and tutorials I figured out how to get my naviation to be responsive.

Parts of my work were guided by W3Schools but all code is original/heavily edited.
